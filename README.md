# Asynchronous
Asynchronous is usually used to describe communications in which data can be transmitted intermittently rather than in a steady stream. For example, a telephone conversation is asynchronous because both parties can talk whenever they like. If the communication were synchronous, each party would be required to wait a specified interval before speaking.
# Asynchronous Communication
Asynchronous communication is any type of communication that doesnâ€™t happen in real time and allows the recipient or recipients of information to respond on their own time. Email, video recording tools, and internal wikis are all forms of asynchronous communication.
Synchronous communication, on the other hand, is any type of communication that expects an instantaneous or near-real-time response, such as in-person conversation, phone calls, video calls, and messaging apps, like Slack.

# Benefits of Asynchronous Communication
    Allows your team to focus on deep work for long stretches of time.
    Gives people time to digest information before replying.
    Creates documentation as an artifact of communication which can be reused later on.
    Cheaper than a meeting because reading is faster than listening.
    Allows introverts to contribute more easily to discussions.
    Gives your team the freedom to not always be online.


# Difficulty
The difficulty with asynchronous communications is that the receiver must have a way to distinguish between valid data and noise. In computer communications, this is usually accomplished through a special start bit and stop bit at the beginning and end of each piece of data. For this reason, asynchronous communication is sometimes called start-stop transmission.
Most communications between computers and devicesare asynchronous.
